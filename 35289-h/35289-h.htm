<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Johns Hopkins Hospital,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: .5em;"><span class="smcap">Baltimore, Maryland,</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;"><i>December, 1915.</i></span><br /><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>ONE of my good friends, a stanch upholder of
what to him is "The Catholic Church," looks
back to the thirteenth century as marking the highest
tide of Christian civilization. He longs for a restoration
(but under other rule) of that monastic
life which then gave shelter to Art, Science, Learning,
and Religion. It does not appear that this
longing is coupled with any regret for the exceptionally
happy domestic life with which he personally
has been blessed. Probably his hopes are
that even if he establishes, others will maintain,
that monastic life and discipline which, duly purified
from Ultramontane tendencies, he thinks would
be so uplifting and beneficial to our times.</div>

<p>However that may be, if he is ever immured
for many weeks in a great hospital, he will be surprised
to find how many are the similarities between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
its life, its discipline and its atmosphere,
and those of the great monasteries. I mean those
medi&aelig;val houses which spread from the parent at
Monte Cassino to Citeaux and Cluny and Vezelay
and thence to far-away parts of Europe, and which
were even more abundant in England where the
ruins of the Yorkshire Abbeys still attest to their
former power. When the time is ripe for the change
longed for by our friend he will find that very
slight additions to a modern hospital will give him
what he wants in great perfection.</p>

<p>Grateful though I am to them&mdash;deeply grateful&mdash;yet
I know little of the personal history of the
founder of this great hospital which now shelters
me, or of that "Diamond Jim Brady" who built
and endowed this noble wing. Still, I feel sure that
in many ways these benefactors to their race
made their gifts under much the same conditions
as those barons and nobles of old who, led by some
deep feeling, devoted their wealth to the saving,
not only of their own souls, but of the souls and
bodies of their fellow men.</p>

<p>Moreover, if the benefactors who founded and
endowed this hospital resembled the men and
women who made possible the powerful monasteries
of the Middle Ages, there is also a resemblance to
be found between the service that the monks rendered
in their day to humanity and knowledge
and that devotion which to-day inspires the staff
of a great modern hospital. In this very building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
are housed and in constant attendance a large
number of doctors, surgeons and orderlies. Their
quarters, though in many ways like those in a
modern club, are almost equally like the cells of a
great monastery. There probably is not one of the
staff who was not turned to his profession in some
degree by the thought that it would make him of
service to mankind. In another wing live several
hundred nurses. The strength and health and happiness
which appear in the faces of these young
women attest to the good effect for women as well
as for men of discipline and regular attention to
duty. What a shining example is theirs of faithful
and altruistic service to suffering humanity! Indeed
a generous, helpful and encouraging spirit
pervades all the men and women who form the
staff of the hospital. Theirs is a single-minded and
unwearying attention which no monks could have
excelled, nor could the monasteries ever have offered
a wider charity than that which makes white
and colored, Hebrew and Gentile, poor and rich all
objects of the kindly help of a skilful and devoted
company.</p>

<p>I know that the kernel and very centre of the
monastery was the lighted altar in the chapel
where daily the sacred mysteries were enacted.
That is what our friend will need to add to his perfected
institution;&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;I doubt
if the atmosphere will be very different when that
is done. Although this place is world-famous as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
a centre of scientific research and of applied science,&mdash;though,
in general, religion here is worked out
in terms of service,&mdash;yet there are signs that the
spirit has recognition as well as the physical body.
To-day, in the great entrance rotunda stands a
colossal and impressive statue of Christ, his hands
outstretched welcoming the weary and the heavy-laden.
The several hundred nurses have daily
prayers together before they begin their unselfish
work. At the dawn of Christmas morning, the
doctors, nurses and orderlies make the halls resound
with the carols suited to the day; and we hear
how one convalescent who was praising his doctor's
power over his ailments was surprised by the
reply, "It was another power than mine that did
it!" Perhaps he meant that miraculous servant
Radium; perhaps he meant Nature herself; perhaps
he meant something beyond these. He did
not explain.</p>

<p>This devotion with which the staff is consecrated
to altruistic labor is met by a spirit of buoyant
gratitude from those on whom they minister. Our
ward is vibrant with it. Perhaps this is not true at
the very first. The patient arrives in misery. For
a few days he is perhaps made even more miserable.
But during this time he is in seclusion and not visible
to his comrades. Soon he rallies. In bed or
wheel chair he joins other convalescents on the
roof terrace. They compare notes over their
operations. They settle among themselves all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
those great pending questions which have been
engrossing the active outside world and, looking
forward to returning health and strength, a very
joyous spirit pervades the group. These not too
inviting surroundings abound, therefore, in a
hearty thankfulness&mdash;a thankfulness abundant
and sincere, and not unlike what it would be
if it were offered amid solemn rites and with majestic
music before the glowing altar of a monastery.</p>

<p>But in these early days of seclusion the lonely
patient has opportunity for much thinking. Lying
in bed in a room which, as a recent writer described
it, is richly decorated with a white ceiling,
four white walls, a door, a window and a floor,
he has indeed time for thought and for thought
without distraction.</p>

<p>Surrounded as he is by the sick and the maimed,
perhaps one of the first subjects on which he is led
to ponder is the mystery of Pain. What does it
all mean that a God otherwise beneficent should
impose on the creatures he has brought into the
world illness and suffering? Even Prince Siddartha
wondered at it:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Since if, all powerful, he leaves it so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He is not good; and if not powerful,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He is not God?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>In better mood the patient may wonder whether
his personal share of pain is in any sense a penance or
atonement for his own past sins. This is a thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
which is natural and acceptable perhaps to most
minds. But the Saints and Martyrs testifying to
their faith went farther and not only submitted to
but gladly sought pain and suffering. Now pain
and agony well endured undoubtedly strengthen
character. Have we not a vivid example of this before
us in the catastrophe of the European war; a
war which is saved from being wholly evil and
dreadful because out of it has come the spiritual regeneration
of the allied nations who are engulfed in
it? Still it can hardly be expected that ordinary
flesh and blood should in this world, so full of love
and beauty, invite and seek out suffering and disaster
even in order to bear them bravely. Enough
for most of us that if doomed to walk with them
we</p>

<div class='center'>
"Turn the necessity to glorious gain."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But all the same it must be a happy thing for a
sufferer if he can hope with the Martyrs that pain
borne with fortitude may be offered as a sacrifice
and atonement.</div>

<p>In these dull and lonely moments also one inevitably
asks whether it is true that people exist
who are stolid to pain? One may consecrate it
before it comes and after it goes, but to most of us
feeble folk pain when present occupies the whole
limelight and leaves the rest of the stage in darkness!
The only inmate of the hospital who stirred
my temper was a patient who on making a rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
recovery from what he described as a very severe
operation said he had refused ether and did not
mind pain. I regained my equanimity when an
orderly confided to me that the operation had
been slight!</p>

<p>In health one is apt to think that Love is the
great motive power of humanity. In illness and
suffering Pain seems the great and pressing problem.
They often go hand in hand and perhaps it is
true that without them both life has not rendered
its full wealth or its perfect discipline. "The ennobling
depths of pain" need also "the purifying fire
of love" to round out a perfect character.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Incomprehensibly Love's will doth move<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Through this blind world in ways we cannot see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Death giving birth to life. So does deep sorrow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Give birth to rarer joy on some glad morrow."</span><br />
</div>

<p>These and many such questions can be as solemn,
as perplexing and as engrossing as any that exercised
the inmates of the Monastery to which we here
find so much resemblance. As a contrast to such
heart-searching thoughts the patient can wonder
at the properties of that radium by which he may
have been treated. How astonishing is it that this
atom of matter should constantly emit rays which
search out and destroy evil tissues and leave unharmed
the good; and that they do this without
any perceptible diminution of energy! How
contrary this is to all we have hitherto known of
the conservation of energy and of the impossibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
of obtaining perpetual motion or continued power!
What is so contrary to our preconceived ideas
proves itself, however, by experience efficient in
an almost supernatural or miraculous manner.
Perhaps fatigued by these thoughts the patient
can turn from them and closing his eyes begin to
count "The flock of sheep that leisurely pass by one
after one" and by happy chance submit himself to
sleep.</p>

<p>The roof terrace has a wide view over the City
of Baltimore, as well as of the heavens which encompass
it. We sit there in our wheel chairs or lie
tucked up in our rolling beds and talk flows freely.
We watch the flocks of pigeons making endless
circles in the upper air; the black and solemn buzzards
hanging above us unmoved though the gale
blow ever so fiercely; the cloud shadows moving
over the panorama; the haze of mist and steam and
smoke floating over the City; the ever-changing
pageant of fleeting clouds and blue sky and blazing
sunsets. At one time&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And when the wind from place to place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Doth the unmoored cloud galleons chase"&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>we follow the white fleets as they sail away towards
the south, ever replaced by new armadas surging
up and over the northern horizon. At another time
in range beyond range of snowy clouds, we see
rise before us the Delectable Mountains beyond
which is the Land of Beulah where the shining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
ones go to and fro as messengers to the Celestial
City.</div>

<p>It is said that an eye unused to the telescope
cannot see the canals on the planet Mars, but
that through the same instrument they are plainly
visible to an eye trained to such observation.
Sometimes, when the clouds have hung in white
masses over the city, I have been eager to see
what was hidden by those luminous walls, but my
untrained eyes could not pierce them. Day after
day, however, I became more familiar with them.
Others before now, without journeying like Columbus
to prove the truth of his visions, have,
even by their own firesides, enjoyed Castles in the
Air and Ch&acirc;teaux and great possessions in Spain.
In like manner as the breeze moved the silver
edges of the clouds, I had unexpectedly through
the rifts views of strange lands and fair cities which
I had never before seen or heard of. As they were
indeed lovely, in all haste I tried to make rapid
notes of them to prove the truth of my strange
experience.</p>

<p>Far to the north over Homewood, a pile of mountainous
clouds was rent for a short space by the
breeze, and disclosed a Minster in a meadow land.
Its name seemed to be Upthorpe-cum-Regis. Its
tower rose before me over the busy life of the
town and looked down on the mansion of the Squire
and the house of the Dean. Close around the walls
of the Minster, indeed within sound of its prayers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
and anthems, were clustered the graves of the
dead,&mdash;the former generations who had made the
life of the town and who built the church and
worshipped at its altar. It was a town in which the
characters described by Trollope or George Eliot
or Jane Austen would have felt themselves at
home.</p>

<p>Again when a sunset was filling the western sky
with "the incomparable pomp of eve," a break in
the clouds above the gilded towers of Cardinal
Gibbons's Cathedral disclosed an Italian town on
a lovely lake shore. Boats with colored sails lined
the Riva of Ranconezzo. Two piazzas teeming
with life surrounded the Duomo or Cathedral and
from them there were wide views over lake and
mountain scenery. It appears that in the long
ago, the Cardinal Schalchi-Visconti was the benefactor
of this town, and there on the hillside, tree
embowered, was his villa with its little port for
the lake boats. His tomb I also saw, not in the
Duomo, but in the Bramantesque Church of Santa
Prassede, a building resembling the many small
churches in northern Italy due to the refined influence
of Bramante. In my dreaming I entered
the church, and found that the great Cardinal lies
beneath a tomb carved by Mino da Fiesole on the
north side of Santa Prassede.</p>

<p>Then on a cool and crisp day when clouds were
scudding through the sky, between them there
was revealed to me a French town that seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
to bear the name of Rocher-St.-Pol. There was
the river Merle winding its way through meadow
and woodland. A range of hills bounded the
horizon and from the plain rose the Rock. Not
far away the ruined castle of "La Dame Blanche"
crowned a steep hill, and close to the town was the
Ch&acirc;teau Beaumesnil, beetling over the wooded
hillside and bristling with conical towers and burnished
girouettes. The Grande Rue of Rocher-St.-Pol
I saw winding between gabled and half-timbered
houses towards the church on the summit,
and finally a long flight of stairs called by the
people Jacob's ladder brings the pilgrim to the
terrace in front of the church door. The interior
of Ste. Fr&eacute;digonde showed me the same period of
French Gothic which marks the cathedrals of Notre
Dame at Paris and Rheims. Coming out from
Jacob's ladder upon the Parvis, there was a wide
view over the meadows and the river. At the
moment when the cathedral door was disclosed to
me, a procession of clergy bearing sacred relics
emerged from the church. It passed between the
ranks of prophets and martyrs whose effigies flank
the portal, and vanished with its banners and vestments
down the long incline of Jacob's ladder
towards the old town.</p>

<p>And finally came a dismal day, at the end of
which the west was lined with long streaks of red,
and, just before sunset, through a lengthened break
in the gray, I seemed to see an Island in the far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
&AElig;gean. I think it must have been somewhere
between the &AElig;gina that looks across the waters to
the Athenian Acropolis and the Assos which my
friends in their youth dug from its grave. Let us
call it &AElig;ginassos. Its buildings as I dimly saw
them are in a remarkable condition of preservation.
The white temple stood out on a promontory
over the sea, and brought back to memory the
temple-crowned headland at Sunium. Higher on
the mountain-side was the Forum with its terraces
and long colonnades. Steep and winding paths
descended to the ancient port, and far across the
water rose the heights of the Isles of Greece.</p>

<p>Here are the records of what I was privileged to
see from the roof terrace of the Hospital. Made
in bed or wheel chair and depending on the passing
imagination of an invalid, the sketches are of
necessity crude. Would that instead they were like
the work of Claude or Turner, who were the great
experts at seeing visions in the clouds and in
transferring them to their paper! These drawings
will, however, be a reminder that idle hours can
be passed happily even during a long captivity!
Opposite each drawing I have placed some quotations
from various writers. Although these do
not describe with exactness the places which no
eye but mine has seen, yet they do picture others
very like those which I saw from the hospital
terrace.</p>

<p>A day at last arrived when the patient was suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
released. After being the object of tender care
for many weeks the outer world seemed very large
and very hustling. It was with a certain timidity
and almost with reluctance that facing it all
he left the peaceful quiet of the Johns Hopkins
Hospital.</p>

along and sat down together, with no thought that life
would ever change much for them; they would only get
bigger and not go to school, and it would be always like
the holiday; they would always live together and be
fond of each other. And the mill with its booming&mdash;the
great chestnut tree under which they played at

banks seemed like home, and Tom was always seeing
water-rats while Maggie gathered the purple plumy

all, the great Floss, along which they
wandered with a sense of travel, to see the rushing
spring-tide, the awful Eagre, come up like a hungry
monster, or to see the Great Ash which had once wailed
and groaned like a man&mdash;these things would always be
just the same to them. Tom thought people were at a

and Maggie when she read about Christiana passing
"the river over which there is no bridge," always saw
the Floss between the green pastures by the Great Ash.</p>

save for the cawing of the rooks who had built their nest
among the branches of some tall old trees, and were
calling to one another, high up in the air. First one
sleek bird, hovering near his ragged house as it swung
and dangled in the wind, uttered his hoarse cry, quite
by chance as it would seem, and in a sober tone as
though he were but talking to himself. Another answered,
and he called again, but louder than before;
then another spoke and then another; and each time the
first, aggravated by contradiction, insisted on his case
more strongly. Other voices, silent till now, struck in
from boughs lower down and higher up and midway,
and to the right and left, and from the tree-tops; and
others arriving hastily from the grey church turrets and
old belfry window, joined the clamour which rose and
fell, and swelled and dropped again, and still went on;
and all this noisy contention amidst a skimming to and
fro, and lighting on fresh branches, and frequent changes
of place, which satirized the old restlessness of those
who lay so still beneath the moss and turf below, and
the useless strife in which they had worn away their
lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I was walking with him last night, he asked me
how I liked the good man whom I have just now mentioned?
and without staying for my answer told me, that
he was afraid of being insulted with Latin and Greek at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his own table; for which reason he desired a particular
friend of his at the university to find him out a clergyman
rather of plain sense than much learning, of a good
aspect, a clear voice, a sociable temper, and, if possible,
a man that understood a little of backgammon. "My
friend," says Sir Roger, found me out this gentleman,
who, besides the endowments required of him, is, they
tell me, a good scholar, though he does not show it. I
have given him the parsonage of the parish; and because
I know his value, have settled on him a good annuity
for life....</p>

<p>At his first settling with me, I made him a present of
all the good sermons which have been printed in English,
and only begged of him that every Sunday he would pronounce
one of them in the pulpit. Accordingly he has
digested them into such a series, that they follow one
another naturally, and make a continued system of
practical divinity.</p>

<p>As Sir Roger was going on in his story, the gentleman
we were talking of came up to us, and upon the
Knight's asking him who preached to-morrow, for it
was Saturday night, told us, the bishop of St. Asaph in
the morning, and Dr. South in the afternoon. He then
showed us his list of preachers for the whole year, where
I saw with a great deal of pleasure, Archbishop Tillotson,
Bishop Saunderson, Dr. Barrow, Dr. Calamy, with
several living authors who have published discourses of
practical divinity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> night I lay at the Swan Inn in Lathbury town.
A sad night I had of it! My chamber was warmed fair
enough by a fire of sea coal. There was a sweet smell of
lavender in the sheets which a hot warming pan had
also made comfortable. All this promised well, but
Polly had forgot to put my silk night cap into my saddlebags!
That vexed me sore! All night I felt I was taking
a rheum. Some clodhoppers roystering in the tap room
forbade sleep at first and as I am not wont to hear the
quarters stricken the Abbey bells roused me at frequent
intervals and made me swear roundly. About midnight
the Royal Mail rolled over the bridge with a noise fit to
wake the Seven Sleepers! The hoof beats of its cattle
echoed on the stone walls of the houses like a salute by
His Majesty's Footguards! How I ached for my quiet
chambers in the Temple. At length I fell to sleep and so
sound that when I waked the sun had long been shining
through my lattice. I was late in meeting the Squire and
the Vicar, and that too after making express this arduous
ride. Indeed I was vexed&mdash;and I showed it.</p>

make them a more desirable food than ambrosia. The

an inhabitant of Steyning. One day as I passed through
the town I saw a man painting a new sign over a shop,
a proceeding that so aroused my curiosity that I stood
for a minute or two to look on. The painter filled in one
letter, gave a huge yawn, looked up and down two or
three times as if he had lost something, and finally descended
from his perch and disappeared. Five weeks
later I passed that way again, and it is a fact that the
same man was at work on the same sign. Perhaps when
the reader takes the walk I am about to recommend to
his attention&mdash;a walk which comprises some of the
finest scenery in Sussex&mdash;that sign will be finished, and
the accomplished artist will have begun another; but I
doubt it. There is plenty of time for everything in
Steyning.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>THE OLD COUNTRY HOUSE</b></div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> our old English folk could not get an arched roof,
then they loved to have it pointed, with polished timber
beams on which the eye rested as on looking upwards
through a tree. Their rooms they liked of many shapes,
and not at right angles on the corners, nor all on the
same dead level of flooring. You had to go up a step
into one, and down a step into another, and along a
winding passage into a third, so that each part of the
house had its individuality. To these houses life fitted
itself and grew to them; they were not mere walls, but
became part of existence. A man's house was not only
his castle, a man's house was himself. He could not tear
himself away from his house, it was like tearing up the
shrieking mandrake by the root, almost death itself....
Dark beams inlaid in the walls support the gables; the
slight curve of the great beam adds, I think, to the interest
of the old place, for it is a curve that has grown
and was not premeditated; it has grown like the bough
of a tree, not from any set human design. This too is
the character of the house. It is not large, not overburdened
with gables, not ornamented, not what is
called striking, in any way, but simply an old English
house, genuine and true. The warm sunlight falls on the
old red tiles, the dark beams look the darker for the
glow of light, the shapely cone of the hop-oust rises at
the end; there are swallows and flowers and ricks and
horses, and so it is beautiful because it is natural and
honest. It is the simplicity that makes it so touching,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
like the words of an old ballad ... why even a tall
chanticleer makes a home look homely. I do like to see a
tall proud chanticleer strutting in the yard and barely
giving way as I advance, almost ready to do battle with
a stranger like a mastiff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram's Hospital</span>, as the retreat is called, is a
picturesque building enough, and shows the correct
taste with which the ecclesiastical architects of those
days were imbued. It stands on the banks of the little
river, which flows nearly round the cathedral close,
being on the side furthest from the town. The London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
road crosses the river by a pretty one-arched bridge,
and looking from this bridge, the stranger will see the
windows of the old men's rooms, each pair of windows
separated by a small buttress. A broad gravel walk
runs between the building and the river, which is always
trim and cared for; and at the end of the walk, under
the parapet of the approach to the bridge, is a large
and well-worn seat, on which, in mild weather three or
four of Hiram's bedesmen are sure to be seen seated.
Beyond this row of buttresses, and further from the
bridge and also further from the water which here suddenly
bends, are the pretty oriel windows of Mr. Harding's
house, and his well mown lawn. The entrance to
the hospital is from the London road and is made
through a ponderous gateway under a heavy stone arch,
unnecessary, one would suppose, at any time, for the
protection of twelve old men, but greatly conducive to
the good appearance of Hiram's charity. On passing
through this portal, never closed to any one from six
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> till ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and never open afterwards, except on
application to a huge, intricately hung medi&aelig;val bell,
the handle of which no un-initiated intruder can possibly
find, the six doors of the old men's abodes are
seen, and beyond them is a slight iron screen, through
which the more happy portion of the Barchester &eacute;lite
pass into the Elysium of Mr. Harding's dwelling.</p>

frequent as to remind one of a theatre. Looking down
from the inn-balcony, between the glazy green pots gay
with scarlet amaryllis-bloom, we are inclined to fancy
that the whole has been prepared for our amusement.
In the morning the cover for the macaroni-flour, after
being washed, is spread out on the bricks to dry. In the
afternoon the fishermen bring their nets for the same
purpose. In the evening the city magnates promenade
and whisper. Dark-eyed women, with orange or crimson
kerchiefs for headgear, cross and re-cross, bearing
baskets on their shoulders. Great lazy large limbed fellows,
girt with scarlet sashes and finished off with dark
blue night-caps (for a contrast to their saffron-colored
shirts, white breeches and sunburnt calves), slouch
about or sleep face downwards on the parapets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> the hand of Time has mellowed the ruddy brick
and the marble's whiteness until ivory and rose blend
and are in harmony with those stained and faded frescoes
which still remain in the panels of the upper walls.
Columns of veined marble stand in ranks on either side
of the entrance. They are mounted on the backs of
stiff-maned lions. Fit supporters are these for the arches
of the Sanctuary as, at its very door, with claw and
tooth they tear to pieces the bestial forms of vice and
ignorance. Above rise the moulded archivolts, tier on
tier, clothed with vine and tendril and peopled with bird
and beast. These may be uncouth in form, but the rude
hands that fashioned them learned their lesson at the
feet of Nature. What there is of convention in arrangement
or in pattern has flowed hither through the East
from the original fountains of Greece and Rome but
now at last all moves in freedom and without restraint.
As in the short nights of the North sunrise follows fast
upon the setting of the sun, so here though we see in this
work the sunset of the Antique yet it is already aglow
with light from the coming dawn of Medi&aelig;val Art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence</span> is more noisy; indeed, I think it the noisiest
town I was ever in. What with the continual jangling
of its bells, the rattle of Austrian drums, and the street
cries, <i>Ancora mi raccapriccio</i>. The Italians are a vociferous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
people, and most so among them the Florentines.
Walking through a back street one day, I saw an old
woman higgling with a peripatetic dealer, who, at every
interval afforded him by the remarks of his veteran antagonist,
would tip his head on one side, and shout,
with a kind of wondering enthusiasm, as if he could
hardly trust the evidence of his own senses to such
loveliness, <i>O, che bellezza! che belle-e-ezza!</i> The two had
been contending as obstinately as the Greeks and Trojans
over the body of Patroclus, and I was curious to
know what was the object of so much desire on the one
side and admiration on the other. It was a half dozen
of weazeny baked pears, beggarly remnant of the day's
traffic.... It never struck me before what a quiet
people Americans are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> semi-dome of the eastern apse above the high
altar is entirely filled with a gigantic half-length figure
of Christ. He raises His right hand to bless and with
His left holds an open book on which is written in Greek
and Latin, "I am the Light of the world." ... Below
him on a smaller scale are ranged the archangels and
the mother of the Lord, who holds the child upon her
knees. Thus Christ appears twice upon this wall, once
as the Omnipotent Wisdom, the Word by whom all
things were made, and once as God deigning to assume
a shape of flesh and dwell with men. The magnificent
image of supreme Deity seems to fill with a single influence
and to dominate the whole building. The house
with all its glory is his. He dwells there like Pallas in
her Parthenon or Zeus in his Olympian temple. To left
and right over every square inch of the cathedral blaze
mosaics, which portray the story of God's dealings with
the human race from the Creation downwards, together
with those angelic beings and saints who symbolize
each in his own degree some special virtue granted to
mankind. The walls of the fane are therefore an open
book of history, theology and ethics for all men to read.</p>

There stately the oleanders grow,<br />

With golden oranges burning between<br />
Their dark stiff leaves of sombre green.<br />
And there are hedges all clipped and square,<br />
As carven from blocks of malachite,<br />
Where fountains keep spinning their threads of light<br />
And statues whiten the shadow there.<br />
And if the sun too fiercely shine,<br />
And one would creep from its noonday glare,<br />

The smallness and grace of this little church gleaming

<h2>ROCHER-ST.-POL</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><b>FRENCH TOWNS</b></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a drowsy little Burgundian town, very old and
ripe, with crooked streets, vistas always oblique, and
steep moss-covered roofs.... I carried away from
Beaune the impression of something autumnal,&mdash;something
rusty yet kindly, like the taste of a sweet
russet pear.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</b></div>

<p>At Le Mans as at Bourges, my first business was with
the cathedral, to which I lost no time in directing my
steps.... It stands on the edge of the eminence of the
town, which falls straight away on two sides of it, and
makes a striking mass, bristling behind, as you see it
from below, with rather small but singularly numerous
flying buttresses. On my way to it I happened to
walk through the one street which contains a few ancient
and curious houses,&mdash;a very crooked and untidy lane,
of really medi&aelig;val aspect, honored with the denomination
of the Grand Rue. Here is the house of Queen
Berengaria.... The structure in question&mdash;very sketchable,
if the sketcher could get far enough away from it&mdash;is
an elaborate little dusky fa&ccedil;ade, overhanging the
street, ornamented with panels of stone, which are covered
with delicate Renaissance sculpture. A fat old
woman, standing in the door of a small grocer's shop
next to it,&mdash;a most gracious old woman, with a bristling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
moustache and a charming manner,&mdash;told me
what the house was.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</b></div>

<p>This admirable house, in the centre of the town,
gabled, elaborately timbered, and much restored, is a
really imposing monument. The basement is occupied
by a linen-draper, who flourishes under the auspicious
sign of the M&egrave;re de Famille; and above her shop the
tall front rises in five overhanging stories. As the house
occupies the angle of a little <i>place</i>, the front is double,
and carved and interlaced, has a high picturesqueness.
The Maison d'Adam is quite in the grand style, and I
am sorry to say I failed to learn what history attaches
to its name.</p>

<p>I remember going around to the church, after I had
left the good sisters, and to a little quiet terrace, which
stands in front of it, ornamented with a few small trees
and bordered with a wall, breast high, over which you
look down steep hillsides, off into the air, and all about
the neighboring country. I remember saying to myself
that this little terrace was one of those felicitous nooks
which the tourist of taste keeps in his mind as a picture.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>A COUNTRY TOWN</b></div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> wake you early in this hilly town. It was
hardly light this morning when up and down through
all its highways went a vigorous drum beat. Reluctantly
peeking from the window to see the troops enter our
square I was disappointed to find that one regimental
drummer, marching unaccompanied and lonely, had
done all this mischief. What useful purpose did he
serve? After a brief respite and repose the noise of another
commotion came in with the morning air; a murmur
which grew and became a chatter and at last a din!
The next journey to the window showed that the morning
market was in full swing. Piles of fresh greens and
rich-colored vegetables were tended by gnarled old
peasant women sitting under widespread umbrellas of
faded colors. But what a pleasant air it was that came
through the opened sash; a mountain air with just that
faint flavor of garlic tinging it which presages something
satisfying to be found later. Strengthened for a time by
our coffee and rolls we wandered through these winding
streets. We saw the weather-beaten, leaden fl&egrave;che of the
cathedral high on the hill, but for the time were satisfied
to study the many ancient houses which still remain.
Their fronts framed in dark oak with a filling of amber-colored
plaster topple over the public ways until they
almost meet. Here and there the oak beams are carved,
and grinning man or snarling monster regards you from
corbel or boss. In places too there are bits of old Gothic
detail and one doorway of true Flamboyant work.
There is the true poetry of architecture! In England
the Decorated Period gives you what is handsome, the
Perpendicular what is stately. In France the cathedrals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of Paris and of Rheims are splendidly serious and
correct; but if in Gothic work you seek imaginative,
unrestrained, carelessly free poetry it is to be found in
the flowing lines and exuberant fancy of the work of the
Flamboyant period.</p>

awning of the caf&eacute;. Here we looked out on the Grand
Place which had now become sleepy, all signs of the
market and its business having disappeared. On it front
the Mairie, the Bureau des Postes, the H&ocirc;tel du Lion
d'Or and various centres of local commerce. We watched
our neighbors in the caf&eacute;; the colonel with clanking
sword in vigorous discussion with a local magnate; the
retired bourgeois who played a desultory game of billiards
or a deeply thought out match at dominoes. A
quiet square it was now, and, in the shade of its plane
trees, comfortable and at peace with the world, we fell
asleep and made up for the wakefulness of our earlier
hours.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor</span><br />
Kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far off the noises of the world retreat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loud vociferations of the street</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Become an undistinguishable roar.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So as I enter here from day to day,</span><br />
And leave my burden at this minster gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,</span><br />
The tumult of the time disconsolate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To inarticulate murmurs dies away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the eternal ages watch and wait.</span><br />
<br />
How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This crowd of statues, on whose folded sleeves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers</span><br />
And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!</span><br />
Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What exultations trampling on despair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,</span><br />
What passionate outcry of the soul in pain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uprose this poem of the earth and air,</span><br />

Stern faces bleared with immemorial watch,<br />
Looked down benignly grave and seemed to say,<br />

<div class='center'><br /><b>CHARTRES</b></div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> day the sky had been banked with thunderclouds,
but by the time we reached Chartres, toward four
o'clock, they had rolled away under the horizon, and
the town was so saturated with sunlight that to pass into
the cathedral was like entering the dense obscurity of a
church in Spain. At first all detail was imperceptible:
we were in a hollow night. Then, as the shadows gradually
thinned and gathered themselves up into pier and
vault and ribbing, there burst out of them great sheets
and showers of color. Framed by such depths of darkness,
and steeped in a blaze of mid-summer sun, the
familiar windows seemed singularly remote and yet
overpoweringly vivid. Now they widened into dark-shored
pools splashed with sunset, now glittered and
menaced like the shields of fighting angels. Some were
cataracts of sapphires, others roses dropped from a
saint's tunic, others great carven platters strewn with
heavenly regalia, others the sails of galleons bound for
the Purple Islands; and in the western wall the scattered
fires of the rose window hung like a constellation in an
African night. When one dropped one's eyes from these
ethereal harmonies, the dark masses of masonry below
them, all veiled and muffled in a mist pricked by a few
altar lights, seemed to symbolize the life on earth, with
its shadows, its heavy distances and its little islands of
illusions. All that a great cathedral can be, all the meanings
it can express, all the tranquillizing power it can
breathe upon the soul, all the richness of detail it can
fuse into a large utterance of strength and beauty, the
cathedral of Chartres gave us in that perfect hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> spent yesterday in the For&ecirc;t de C&mdash;&mdash;. As the
Emperor had guests we were not admitted at the Ch&acirc;teau,
but we tramped for long through the woods. The
grassy roads run beneath the embowering beeches
straight from carrefour to carrefour. The gnarled and
twisted trunks give to each tree a personal character
and make it a master-piece of Nature. Of a sudden we
came on the Imperial hunt winding in gay procession
through the forest to its rendezvous. Hunting horns in
triple rings of brass encircled the leading horsemen.
From time to time we heard from them the familiar
strains which echo through the Latin Quarter at Mi-Car&ecirc;me.
Then followed in brilliant liveries a troop of
lackeys, grooms, and other servants, and the pack of
staghounds held in leash but sniffing and yelping. Next
came the hunters themselves on high-bred mounts and
in court costumes of ancient design. Lastly there were
barouches and landaus carrying the ladies of the Court
"en grande tenue." The sunlight flickering through the
beech branches enlivened this brilliant train as it
wound through the forest glades and disappeared down
a green all&eacute;e.</p>

<p>We had continued our walk for scarce a mile when,
but a short distance from us, a stag crossed our path&mdash;stood
startled&mdash;with head erect,&mdash;and then with confident
leaps vanished in the forest just as the distant
hounds became aware of him and joined in a wild
chorus. In a few moments the pack came in a rush
across our path. Up the different all&eacute;es rode the horsemen
in haste&mdash;asking of us news of the stag. We on
foot joined in the pursuit,&mdash;but at last the forest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
swallowed one after the other, stag, and hounds, and
hunters, and the sound of dog and horn.</p>

<p>On leaving the forest we passed the small Ch&acirc;teau.
Its conical turret roofs and lofty chimneys, and its
flashing finials and girouettes make a brave show above
the forest trees. The terraces overlook wide meadow
lands through which the river winds until it is lost in the
hazy distance.</p>

They drew their swords so sharp and bright<br />
They thought on their sister sweet;<br />
They struck together the felon knight,<br />

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
